Dataset Description:
The dataset used in this analysis is named "listings.csv." It likely contains information about Airbnb listings, which can include details about properties, prices, reviews, and more. The objective is to prepare this dataset for analysis and gain insights from it.
Data Cleaning Steps:
Load and Examine the Dataset:

We start by loading the dataset into a DataFrame (listing_df) and display the first 100 rows to understand its structure and content.
Data Types:

We examine the data types of columns using .info() and .dtypes. Understanding data types is crucial as it helps determine how to handle each column during analysis.
Basic Statistics:

Calculating basic statistics using .describe() provides an initial overview of numerical columns, including measures like mean, standard deviation, and quartiles.
Checking for Missing Values:

We use .isnull().sum() to count missing values in each column. Missing values can affect the quality of analysis, so we identify columns with missing data.
Percentage of Missing Values:

Calculating the percentage of missing data helps assess the extent of data loss. It's essential to understand how much data is missing before deciding on strategies to handle it.
Checking for Duplicate Values:

Identifying and removing duplicate rows is important to maintain data integrity. We use .duplicated().sum() to count duplicate rows.
Total Number of Rows and Columns:

Determining the dataset's size in terms of rows and columns is a fundamental step for data understanding and analysis.
Removing Empty Columns:

We demonstrate how to remove columns with missing values (NaN). However, this step should be performed with caution, as it may result in a loss of valuable data.
Filling Missing Values:

In the 'reviews_per_month' column, we fill missing values with the mean value. This preserves data while addressing missing data concerns.
Dropping Unnecessary Columns:

Columns like 'license' and 'scrape_id' contain no data and are dropped to reduce clutter in the dataset.
Correcting Unformatted Data:

The 'price' column is converted from a string to a numerical format. Non-numeric characters ('$' and ',') are removed, allowing for numerical analysis.
Purpose of Data Cleaning:
Data cleaning is an essential step in the data analysis process. It ensures that the dataset is accurate, complete, and in a suitable format for analysis. Here's why we took these data cleaning steps:

Handling Missing Data: Identifying and addressing missing data is crucial for accurate analysis. Missing data can lead to biased results or errors in statistical calculations. In this case, we assessed the extent of missing data and filled missing values in the 'reviews_per_month' column.

Removing Duplicates: Duplicate rows can skew analysis results, especially when calculating statistics or building models. By checking for and removing duplicates, we ensure data accuracy.

Column Removal: Columns like 'license' and 'scrape_id' were removed because they contained no useful information. Keeping unnecessary columns can clutter the dataset.

Data Type Conversion: Converting the 'price' column to a numeric format is essential for performing numerical calculations. Cleaning non-numeric characters ensures accurate analysis.

Dataset Purpose:
The purpose of this dataset and data cleaning process is likely for further analysis and insights into Airbnb listings. Data cleaning prepares the dataset for tasks such as pricing analysis, identifying popular neighborhoods, and understanding factors influencing listing prices.
The cleaned dataset can now be used for various data analysis tasks, including visualizations, statistical modeling, and generating actionable insights for business or research purposes.

Insights
Popular Neighborhoods
University District neighborhoods tend to be more popular than others.
Factors contributing to this popularity include proximity to tourist attractions, safety, access to public transportation, and the availability of amenities.
Listing Prices
Listing prices exhibit significant variation due to multiple factors, including property type, number of bedrooms, amenities, location, and seasonality.
Larger properties with more bedrooms and amenities often have higher prices.
Properties located in desirable neighborhoods or close to major attractions tend to have higher listing prices.
Prices can fluctuate seasonally, with peak tourist seasons generally associated with higher prices.
Correlation Insights
Correlation analysis reveals relationships between different features.
Positive correlations exist between the number of bedrooms and price, indicating that larger properties tend to be more expensive.
Positive correlations between amenities, location, and price suggest that well-equipped properties in desirable neighborhoods can command higher prices.
Average House Price
Determining the average house price provides a key summary statistic that offers an overview of the property market's central tendency.
These insights are derived from data analysis and are valuable for purposes such as pricing strategies, marketing decisions, and understanding traveler preferences. They serve as a foundation for data-driven decision-making in the real estate or hospitality industry.
